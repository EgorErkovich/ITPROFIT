### Project Scripts

The project contains the following scripts that you can use:

- `npm run lint`: Analyzes the code in the `src` directory for problematic patterns using ESLint.
- `npm run lint:fix`: Automatically fixes problems in the `src` directory using ESLint with the `--fix` option.
- `npm run start`: Starts the development server with Webpack Dev Server for real-time testing with hot reloading.
- `npm run build`: Builds the project using Webpack, creating optimized files for production.
- `npm run server`: Starts the backend server defined in `server/index.js`.
- `npm run dev`: Runs both the server and development server concurrently for simultaneous frontend and backend development.
